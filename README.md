## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

<br>
From the results of our multiple linear regression (shown above) we conclude the following. 
- According to our results vehicle length, ground clearance, as well as intercept are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. Vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on MPG. Since our intercept is statistically significant, we conclude there are other variables and factors that contribute to the variation in MPG that have not been included in our model. We may also conclude that we have not yet accounted for these variables/factors and that they still need to be collected or observed.
- Since the p-value of our linear regression is 5.35 x 10^-11, which is significantly smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero. 
- Our r-squared value is ~.71, meaning roughly 71% of our MPG predictions will be accurate when using this linear model. While this is significant, as stated in our first bullet point above, there are significant variables that we have not yet accounted for that would make our predictive model even more accurate.
